1- Preheat the sensro: Connect the sensor to the Arduino and leave it running for 24 hours in clean ear. it's better for the tempetature to be 20c and the humidity is 33%.

2- Calculate R0: After 24 of preheating, calculate the R0 in clean air.
- Open arduino C and load the MQ135 Library(Sketch>>Include Library)
-Open the MQ135.h (C:\Users\[USERNAME]\Documents\Arduino\libraries\MQ135) and set the value float rload=1.0
-Run the file Calculate_R0.ino and wait until the R0 reach to fixed value (30-1h)
-Open the MQ135.h and set the float rzero to the value calculated from the previous step.
-Now, we are ready to read gas consentration by running the file Calculate_Gas_PPM.ino
